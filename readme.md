This is The Geek Cook, a personal blog about development, cooking and all that's around both of them.

It's powered by [Toto](http://cloudhead.io/toto) and it's currently based on modifications of its core theme, [Dorothy](https://github.com/cloudhead/dorothy).

Both the website files and contents are available here on GitHub.

See here for the ideas behind this structure.
