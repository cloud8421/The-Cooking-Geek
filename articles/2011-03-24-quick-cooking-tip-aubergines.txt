title: "Quick cooking tip: aubergines"
date: 24/03/2011

Again, an old trick with aubergines. A few hours before cooking them, slice them and put them on a plate with coarse salt on both sides. It will drain out water from the aubergines, taking away their bitterness.
You will just need to wash them before cooking.
