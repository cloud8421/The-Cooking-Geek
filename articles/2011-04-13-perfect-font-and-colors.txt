title: Perfect font and colors
date: 13/04/2011

My friend Nicola calls me a turbo-nerd, which is something I'm really proud of. I also lack any kind of graphical attitude, meaning that I simply can't draw.

This doesn't mean I can't appreciate good typography and a great color scheme. That's why I can say this is my lucky week.

### The perfect monospace font

I was reading [Thomas Fuchs's interview on the setup](http://thomas.fuchs.usesthis.com/) and I came across this passage:

> Since I'm a sucker for typography, I searched for ages for the perfect programming and command line font until I finally found one.

I followed the link to a [post on his blog](http://mir.aculo.us/2010/10/12/the-long-search-for-a-terminal-font-is-over/) talking about monospaced fonts and there it was, the perfect monospace font: **Meslo**. Great lines with antialising, a variant with large vertical spacing between lines, unicode support and choice between slashed and dotted 0. It instantly killed Monaco and became the absolute king in Terminal, Textmate, Vim, Notational Velocity, everywhere.

### The perfect color scheme

This was linked by Nicola. It's an [absolutely gorgeous color scheme called Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized), available in dark and light versions at this address.

I've also found a [Textmate port by Adamv on Github](https://github.com/adamv/textmate-themes/) that is fully featured with additional element definitions that work wonderfully with Ruby, Rails and PHP on the server side and HTML, CSS and Javascript on the client side. I couldn't ask for anything better than this.

Unfortunately the dark version of Solarized doesn't work really well with the output of some commands I use in the terminal (namely the output of some ruby tasks), so I'll stick with the light one for now.
