title: Being opinionated is good
date: 04/06/2011

I never thought about "opinionated software" before starting using Rails. Frankly, I never thought the notion could exist.

The idea is a direct consequence of the "convention over configuration" principle: the software strongly encourages a series of conventions that make development faster and easier, but require you to embrace them.

To clear advantage is that you may build a prototype in no-time: having something working is the best option to understand if you're on the right track, especially when it comes to functionality and flow.

Being opinionated is good: choices are made on your behalf and you can concentrate on building your software instead of trying to make it work from scratch.

Of course there are ways to subvert conventions: speaking about Rails, there are tons of gems, libraries and ways to change its default behaviour. The fact that they need to be applied on the framework acts as a good filter: only those people who have a real need to change the way it works follow that path, and sometimes this results in discovering that the new pattern is smart enough to be adopted by the Rails itself.

After all, every developer starts building his own toolset and it's highly opinionated. Variations on a certain pattern, libraries we prefer over others, techniques we are more comfortable with. While a good developer always tries some experimentation, he uses his own approach to get stuff done.
