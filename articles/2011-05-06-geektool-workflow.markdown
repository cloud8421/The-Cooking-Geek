[GeekTool][1] is a handy utility that you can use to have some specific pieces of content on your desktop.

It’s useful to show the results of a command you need to monitor, some specific pieces of information (like weather info) or simply to show date and time in more fashion style.

<div class="img_container"><img class="frame" src="/img/geektool1.jpg" alt="GeekTool 1" /></div>

I use it mainly to store commands I’m memorizing. Once I’m sure I remember them, they get deleted from the file, so my desktop shows me only what I need to see.

<div class="img_container"><img class="frame" src="/img/geektool2.jpg" alt="GeekTool 2" /></div>

I also removed the date and time from the menu bar to show them on the desktop. It helps me in not checking out the time every 10 minutes, but focusing on what I’m doing. If I’ve got a scheduled task, I simply set an alarm.

Here some useful resources to set it up:
