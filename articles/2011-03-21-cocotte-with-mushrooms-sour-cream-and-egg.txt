Cocottes are a tricky business: there are a lot of recipes you can cook with a cocotte, and most of them involve an oven. That always makes me a bit uncomfortable, as I prefer pan-based cooking.

Anyway, this was taken from a book but I made some small tweaks.

### Ingredients (2 people)

- 1 Kg of mushrooms (I know it seems a lot, but they get smaller when cooking as they lose water) - Porcini are good for this, but I used [Antunna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleurotus_eryngii) (sardinian ones - should be King Trumpet).
- Sour Cream (250 g)
- 2 eggs
- Parsley
- 1 slice of garlic
- 1/2 red onion
- Olive oil
- Salt and pepper

### Preparation

First things first, we need to cut the mushrooms in edible chunks. They need to be good bites.
Then let's finely slice the garlic and the onion and put them in a large pan with a couple of table spoons of oil.
As soon as it starts to fry, we will add the mushrooms (keep at a medium-low fire). While we keep an eye on them, we can cut the parsley and add it to the mix. Feel free to add it depending on your taste, I usually put a couple of handfuls. Depending on how much water there's inside the mushrooms, you may need to add some for them to cook properly. If you see that they're drying up, add some water (half a glass at once at most, you can eventually repeat the process).
While mushrooms are cooking, turn on the oven at 170Â° C.
Cooking mushrooms may take quite some time from 20 minutes to 40, depending on how big the chunks are. Taste them, they need to be cooked but not too soft.
Once they're ready, eliminate the water in excess if there's any.
Fill 2/3 of the cocottes with mushrooms. Then cover them with the sour cream and break an egg on top. Salt and pepper and back into the oven for 10-15 minutes at most: you need to cook the egg without boiling it.

### Ideas

I'd say this is a comforting recipe, quite heavy but fun to prepare. The only issue I had is that the egg can easily burn and dry in minutes, so that's something to really take care of.
