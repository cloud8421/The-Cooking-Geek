title: Switching away from Things (for now)
date: 10/03/2011

I’ve always tried to have a somewhat solid method to manage tasks, but
despite my good will I tend to shift from one system to another without
real consistency. I still rely on memory not to forget about what I need
to do and it’s more or less worked so far.

I’ve tried multiple times to use [Things][], mostly for its beatiful
user interface and its good balance between a project management and a
todo list. I still feel that it applies an abstraction layer that makes
everything more complicated than it sounds.

That’s why I’ve decided to switch to a simpler tool, namely
[TaskPaper][]. The reason is that it uses a simple markup language to in
a pure text environment. No buttons unless you want to (and I just keep
the search bar visible).

This helps me in keeping a similar mindset: coding is a form of writing,
task management is anotheer form of writing, writing this post is a
third form. Different languages but a common ground among them. I feel
that being consistent in the way I work will be worth the effort.
