Microsoft has presented a video detailing the major features of their next update to the Windows Phone 7 platform, named Mango.

I'm glad to say I was blown away by the sheer amount of vision: the core concepts, the ideas, all screamed pure creativity.

I don't want to go into details describing what the software will do, as the video itself is self-explanatory. Moreover, I don't want to spoiler the surprise if you haven't seen it. You should watch it now.

The point is, this is something to be glad about: a different take on mobile software, features that make a platform compelling without making a carbon clone of another os.

Many people say that great innovation comes when there's competition that forces companies to push boundaries and find new solutions. It is true, it is something to hope for.

As a tech entusiast, I'm thrilling seeing that there's a place in Microsoft where ideas happen: in these days of [relentless attacks to Steve Ballmer and pleas for Bill Gates to return](http://gdgt.com/discuss/it-s-time-for-bill-gates-to-come-back-to-microsoft-dqz/) this is a sign of an innovation that was lost behind numbers.

Acquisitions and moves must be watched on a higher perspective and personally I can see a reason for buying Skype after seeing Mango in action.

Mango features a tight integration with social messaging, something that probably hints at a future merging with Skype for audio. The basic idea is that you choose a person and communicated with her through a unified interface that automatically bridges all communications protocols (sms, IM if the person is connected to MSN, Facebook messages). Skype could be a direct extension, but moreover it could be en exclusive integration with Mango, available only for Windows Phone 7.

This is probably why they acquired Skype instead of developing a new technology: to leverage the installed base and provide a compelling feature that could shift the balance when choosing what to buy.

It would be a complex move indeed (and admittedly, not so cheap), but that's the only logic connection I can make.

In any case, I can't wait to see what Apple will present at the [upcoming WWDC](http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/). Next months will be fun.
