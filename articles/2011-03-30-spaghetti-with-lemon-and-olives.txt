This is quite a must for me, as I cook it at least twice a month. It's relatively fast dish, surprisingly fresh and really easy.
I'd say that it's the kind of flavour you either love or hate, as lemon and olives are a strong combination.

### Ingredients (2 people)

- 200-250 g of spaghetti or linguine (I make generous plates)
- 1 big lemon or 2 small ones
- 50 g at least of black olives (taggiasche are the best, you can spot them as they're brownish)
- 5-10 leaves of basil (depending on their size)
- olive oil
- 1 slice of garlic
- salt and pepper

### Preparation

Start by boiling water with salt.

In the meantime, take a big bowl. You will put in all the ingredients step by step.

First of all, you need a grater to help you out with the lemon peel. Feel free to use all the lemon for that.

Next up: mix 3 table spoons of olive oil and the lemon juice in the bowl. Finely slice the garlic and the basil and add them to the mix. Tear apart the olives with your hands before putting them together with the rest. Finish with salt and pepper and taste it to adjust the flavour.

Cook the spaghetti in the boiling water. When they're about to be ready, take a table spoon of cooking water and pour it into the bowl. This will help in mixing the flavours.

Drain the spaghetti and mix them in the bowl. Put the lemon peel directly onto plates. Serve as fast as you can.

### Ideas

Lemon is what really makes the difference in taste: less is better if you like a more delicate taste. You can also avoid to use the peel itself if it seems too harsh.
