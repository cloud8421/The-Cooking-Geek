Here are some topics I want to write about in the future. Writing them down in a post is a way for me to commit to actually write.

Let's start with some programming ones:

- An in-depth look at **Coffeescript**
- A collection of **Rails resources** that have been extremely helpful to start digging into it
- Why I use an editor and not an IDE

And then some food ones:

- Cool things you can season with balsamic vinegar
- Don't be scared by onions
- Some absolutely cool cooking books

Now back to tech:

- If **Windows Phone 7 Mango** rocks, I'll be happy
- My next computer doesn't exist for now
- I hate email, but some software makes it less annoying
- A few months with the Magic Trackpad
- Being opinionated is good
