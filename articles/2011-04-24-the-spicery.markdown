My girlfriend has subscribed to [The Spicery](http://www.thespicery.com/index.html), an awesome website that focuses on spices from all over the world. Their idea is simple: you choose a menu and every month you get different spices in perfect dosage to make specific dishes (their recipes are sent as well).

It's wonderful: you can try out different flavours without the risk of buying too much. And our curry-based dinner kicked ass (that will be published as well).
