title: "Quick cooking tip: colourful vegetables"
date: 25/03/2011

This is an old trick related to vegetables.
Before adding them to the recipe you're cooking, throw them for a minute or even less in boiling water, then take them out and shower them with cold one.
In this way you will keep the vegetable colour as bright as it was before cooking.
