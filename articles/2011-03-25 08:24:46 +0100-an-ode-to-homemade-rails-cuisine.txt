title: An ode to homemade Rails cuisine
date: 25/03/2011

I'm about to complete the extensive [Rails 3 tutorial series by Michael Hartl](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/) and I've mixed feelings.
On the one hand, Rails seems to me very powerful, organized, meaningfully thought and designed. On the other end, the complete shift towards [test-driven development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) is somewhat scary, as it shakes what I've learned so far about web development.

The obsession with clean, concise code and the focus towards refactoring are indeed a philosophy I happily embrace, especially if there's time to take care of that.

I've also come to think that the biggest temptation while using Rails is to take advantage of scaffolding and gems to out together a working app without understanding and taking care of the deepest mechanics. Core functions, data-sensitive logic like authentication and user management should be in control of the developer. That doesn't mean that it cannot be open-sourced. It's exactly the opposite: sometimes a thorough explanation of a library is more useful than simply publishing it on GitHub for people to use.

The analogy with cooking is wonderful: you can buy vegetables that are ready to cook, or you can buy biologic ones, cut and peel them yourself and cook them. They will taste better and have the right shape and size for the dish you're cooking. It takes more time, but you'll get faster by doing it and learn how to speed things up. Moreover, you'll improve your knife skills and develop a better taste for different varieties of a single ingredient.

Coming back to Rails, I'm sure that there's still a lot I've still to grasp and there are indeed a lot of resources I'll check out after finishing the actual tutorial.

Despite my mixed feelings, it's an exciting world where things are vibrant and the conversation is open.
