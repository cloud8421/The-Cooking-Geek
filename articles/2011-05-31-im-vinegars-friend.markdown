Many people don't like vinegar, probably because it was overused during their childhood. We all tried some salads that would simply taste horrible due to a too generous splash of vinegar.

Time to get over that: there are plenty of dishes that really get a boost when properly seasoned with a good vinegar.

I always keep a bottle of balsamic vinegar at hand: it's dark, browny and it should be available in most of the shops (in Italy it's available at the supermarket).

What can you use it for?

I always put half a table spoon in the tomato sauce: a traditional recipe in Italy would require you to use sugar to balance the tomato's acid taste, but I prefer vinegar. It's basic, so you can have a similar effect while also adding a small kick to the sauce. I saw Jamie Oliver doing it a few years ago and it definitely works.

Other famous combinations are with strawberries and grilled meat (beef is great). Green beans are also very good when cooked with balsamic vinegar and water.

On salad: my rule of thumb is that vinegar must not create those brown pools inside oil when stirred. It needs to blend and become invisible. A tablespoon at most for a 2 people salad (and it's a strong flavour).
