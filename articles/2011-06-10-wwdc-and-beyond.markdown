title: WWDC and beyond
date: 10/06/2011

Monitoring the reactions to the WWDC keynote show clearly that the basic reaction is simple: this is too much to process at once.

I won't go into details about what has been shown: the Apple website pages go into great detail with beatiful pictures, bells and whistles. As you can probably guess, here's my take on the whole thing.

<more>

iOS shows some interesting ideas and some expected changes: many people argue that much of the changes are taken from other platforms, but this doesn't bother me at all, as it's impossible to come up with a complete new take on everything. Something's gotta give and if ain't broke don't fix it.

iMessage is a strong facepalm to the carriers, one of the boldest statement for the rest of the industry in the entire keynote. It may seem a minor feature compared to others, but it's a way to help in drawing a line with obsolete technologies that benefit only the carriers themselves (we all know that SMS are expensive).

The fact that you don't need a Mac or a PC to activate and iOS device, that's big. Really big. That's a clear cut with the past and a real chance for comfortable computing for many people: while there are already tons of folks that just use an iPad as their own computing device, they're exposed to the issue of not backing up and not updating the OS. With iCloud, they will have it without any kind of expertise needed.

I think that Apple, Google and Amazon are working towards a similar goal with different attitudes and processes. From my perspective, Google's approach to the cloud is more targeted to enterprise usage, where data means small chunks of numbers and strings. Think about it: Google Docs is all about writing, while Apple's example is all related to media, even when it comes to iWork documents (and I still need to see some real life examples in their keynotes - something not related to school papers).
Amazon is a special case, as it could be an extremely big player but seems tied down by its relationship with majors. Moreover, Amazon hasn't got a platform outside the Kindle. It cannot be the default setup of a device. Google and Apple can.

As [John Gruber said](http://daringfireball.net/2011/06/demoted):
>Google’s frame is the browser window. Apple’s frame is the screen. That’s what we’ll remember about today’s keynote ten years from now.

Apple's take is radical: content is king. We take care of your content, version it, share it, push it, store it. Don't bother thinking about it. Terrifying for geeks, to be honest, but thrilling. We wanted a file system for iOS, as we thought we needed it. Turns out we don't.
In the WWDC keynote, the Finder was shown just when talking about Airdrop, and it didn't look like a file manager at all, with all those happy pictures and radial background.
Hide complexity and change metaphors even in the Mac: it really becomes another device in the chain.

I'm extremely excited, as I feel it will have a direct impact on the way I deal with digital media. I'm happy that Lion hasn't been "dumbed down" in its iOS-ification: both the optional server support and the minor improvements in the UNIX side of it show that I can trust it to be my future working platform.
Some interesting news about the new CSS and HTML features in iOS 5's webkit engine and the new Safari 5.1 beta show that there are improvements on the web side of both platforms, something that should discourage the idea that the future will be all inside apps. I don't buy it, for now.

I'm ready to migrate part of my backing up and syncing workflow to iCloud, even if I'll probably keep using some of the core services I use now for simple data redundancy.

Everybody wonders what Apple is doing with all that cash: iOS 5 is free, iCloud is free for the most part, Lion is 29$. See the pattern there? Hardware is the revenue, software makes the hardware special to use. It's something you can do only if you control the chain from the very beginning to the very end. For those analysts who were disappointed by the fact that there was no hardware announcement, you're simply not getting it: these software updates are an investment in the future, a way to be sure that people will keep on using Apple products when they change Mac, iPhone or iPad. It's lock-in at its finest, except that it's based on features that could actually benefit the user instead of focusing on make it difficult for him to leave.

Most people have simple needs: they want stuff that just works without wondering about how it does that. They don't care about a North Carolina data center or anything like that. They don't even know they should backup. They hate files, simply because they can't grasp the idea. With Lion, they can avoid to deal with that most of the time, how does that sound as an innovation?

Think, analyst: you're seeing software that makes devices already in manufacturing more compelling to use, device that will be more appealing in three months from now than anything you've seen so far.

It's a turning point in technology: Google, Amazon and Apple are simply trying to change the way we deal with technology. They're big, massive companies with ambitious plans for the next 20 years. I'm once again thrilled and excited, but I also want to be a part of the community of people who make smaller things, works of craftmanship to be proud of. My support goes in the first place to them.

One last word for those who speculate about Steve Jobs's health. Stop it, it's really a bad habit, whoever the person is, and makes your article automatically bullshit.
