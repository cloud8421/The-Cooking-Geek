title: Tools shape you
date: 29/04/2011

Tools shape the way you work. That is quite obvious: you rely on them, you perform different tasks with them, you get used to the way they feel when you use them. Whether there's friction or not, it doesn't matter: they subtly filter under your skin day after day.

You could think this is bad: on a certain extent I may agree. Being slave of a tool is not good, but being efficient is. To be efficient, you need to lower your guard and let that tool shape the way you accomplish a certain goal.

### The importance of knowledge and best practices

Especially in the programming and design world there's something called best practices, a generic term that collects the best way of doing something. A best practice is usually derived from the work of experienced people who have a track record that backs up the practice itself. It's something really thought of that hopefully helps youngsters like me in approaching a problem from the right angle.

Best practices are the first thing to learn alongside with knowledge. Why would I want to learn to make a webpage using tables? That's obsolete, inherently wrong and useless nowadays. Therefore, knowing that markup in a webpage needs to be structured in a different way is the basic premise of how I work.

### From best practices to tools

There are plenty of tools that would help me a lot in crafting a wrong webpage (let's go on with tables, even if it's not strictly my area). Tools like ZenCoding or Sparkup and editors like TextMate or VIM may be of great efficiency in helping me doing the wrong thing, but that's my mistake.

Here comes knowledge: the tool doesn't matter as long as you possess that knowledge. You don't need to continuously search for the perfect tool if you don't possess that knowledge. Tools may help you in making less typos, but on a bigger scale, they don't make you a better craftsman.

### Dig deep

When you have that knowledge, that's when you start in judging the way a tool works. The questions are: how can it help me in doing what I know I want to do? How fast can I be with this tool? Am I using its full potential?

It's important to keep an open mind: I use VIM and it has changed a lot the way I look at code. I don't feel it's bad, because I know that if one day I'd need to switch to something else, it'd take me a reasonable amount of time to get accustomed to it. That's because I'd start again following the same pattern: how can I do what I know I need to do with this tool. Is there a resource that can teach me how to do it with this new tool?

The biggest mistake is making the new tool behave like the old one by using hacks and plugins: it's not a reliable method in the long run. It may be a way to make things easier at first, but if you're serious, you need to give up trying and embrace your new tool. It may be tiring and frustrating for a bit, but it's the good thing for you, as you're able to move between different tools and environments, performing the best with each one of them when needed.

It doesn't mean you've to switch you editor once in a while to prove a point. If you're doing great there's no reason to disrupt your workflow, but if you have to, it shouldn't matter so much.

### Why all of this?

I've come to think that the energy required to resist a change is more than the one needed to embrace and make the best out of it. You can be frustrated for months or even years because you live in the past, when your work was better because that tool was better. That's nonsense. Things change and you should as well: we're animals that adapt to change, we do it all the time for bigger stuff than a tool. It's futile to waste energy on that. Focus your energy on learning something new and make the best out of it.
