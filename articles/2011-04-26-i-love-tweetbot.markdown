title: I love TweetBot
date: 26/04/2011

Here are a few reasons why I love [Tweetbot](http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/):

- it'a breath of fresh air from a visual point of view. I'm tired of standard controls, they are simple to use but apps lose personality.
- The conversation view that gets activated in no-time.
- The high-tech spinning wheel for loading that rotates taking into account how much you pull to refresh.
- I love robots.
- No total blue icon.
- I use the gestures provided and they make me faster.
- I love supporting indie developers.

Could I live without it? Absolutely yes, the same way I could live without many other things. But it works for me, it resonates with my imagination and makes my iPhone a bit more fun. For 1,59 â‚¬, that's a lot of stuff.
