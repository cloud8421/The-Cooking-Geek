title: Xcode on the Mac App Store
date: 23/03/2011

I spent some time thinking about why the latest [Xcode](http://developer.apple.com/xcode/) release is also [available on the Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/it/app/xcode/id422352214?mt=12) for 4 €.
Here's my idea. Taken that:

- To download Xcode for free, you need to register yourself to any Developer Program (iOS or Mac, doesn't matter). You don't need to pay upfront, but there's a registration process to undertake.
- To keep Xcode updated, you need to download a new disk image every time from the Developer Portal. Moreover, you need to know that there's an update for Xcode.

I'd pay 4 € to avoid the hassle and be notified by the App Store when I need to update Xcode.

There's also a side effect: if you want to develop a Mac application without publishing it in the App Store (maybe it's an open-source project or it simply can't be accepted due to guidelines violation), you can avoid registering to the Developer Program. This has undesired side effects, by the way, as some resources (e.g. [the training videos for WWDC 2010](http://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2010/)) are not available for unregistered developers.
