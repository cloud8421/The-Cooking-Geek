title: iPad 2 review
date: 03/04/2011

As I said before, I wasn't planning to get an iPad 2. It's been a gift, so I open-heartedly welcomed it. I've also purchased the wi-fi only model, so no 3G evaluation.

### Holding it

From a pure form-factor point of view, there are some major differences: it's thinner, completely flat on the back and any kind of sharp edges have been removed. Instead of the sharp angles of the first iteration, we now have smooth and curvy lines that better fit in the hand when used.
The consequence is simple: you can hold it better for longer periods, especially because hands don't become numb after a while (this happened to me multiple times when using the iPad 1).

The difference in weight is not really big, personally I don't think it's noticeable. It's light the way it was before and as many said, we're miles away from the Kindle.

The complete flatness of the back is the visual difference that contributes the most in giving the impression that it's a major revamp, while in reality it's not. It's an improvement that solves some ergonomic problems that were present in the iPad 1.

It's also interesting to notice that we're in a completely different boat than the iPhone, hopefully some of these design decisions will make it into the design of iPhone 5. On the same perspective, we can find some similarities with the iPhone 4: the touch surface is really close to the glass, so it feels to touch the interface, to interact in a more direct way than in the past. The hardware specs improvements help also in that, let's see why.

### Using it

The new A5 chip and the doubled RAM have a general positive effect on the interface, improving the smoothness of animations (we're at iPhone 4 level). This is something that really gets noticed comparing the devices and it's not such a dramatic improvement. In other words, it's not a good reason to switch.

Right now there aren't really many applications to try out that benefit from the new hardware: I still have to play around with Garage Band (also available for iPad 1) and iMovie, but I spent a good hour with Infinity Blade (as always, games are on the edge).
3D is where iPad 2 shines compared to its predecessor. [Infinity Blade](http://www.epicgames.com/infinityblade/) uses advanced 3D filters that eliminate aliasing on models and this is a clear manifesto on what to expect from the device in the future (not only in games). I've also started to play [Back to the Future from TellTale](http://www.telltalegames.com/bttf), a game I had started and gave up a few weeks ago due to the poor performances on iPad 1 (it's still rough on performance, but playable - update needed).
I've also purchased [Death Rally](http://www.remedygames.com/games/deathrally), which is completely antialiased. The visual improvement in 3D is clearly visible and frame rate is constant at 60fps.

It's a powerful machine and I think we'll see a lot more 3D applications in the future that can really make the difference: I'm thinking about CAD visualizers for real estates, advanced medical applications and my secret secret dream, an iPad IKEA catalog. Please, let's do it.

### HDMI out

Right now we talked about improvements that are nice but don't justify a switch.
The HDMI out is another story: it's a in intelligent mirroring system that really stands out. You can connect an HDMI tv and clone the iPad display. Videos are shown on the TV screen in an astounding quality, with no frame-drop or problems whatsoever.

It's like an Apple TV embedded in the iPad. I'd say that any iPad 2 owner can really avoid to buy an Apple TV, as they really perform the same tasks when connected to the TV.
Apps I usually use for video (Plex) work just fine, so no hiccups.

### Audio

Louder, better, less plastic than before. You may use it for background music if you don't have decent speakers.

### Battery life

I didn't really see the difference here, we're talking about going on two days with normal usage, that means spending a few hours a day surfing the web, playing games and watching movies. In my experience, you can get around for at least two days watching a couple of movies, playing two hours of games and reading and browsing for two-three hours.

As a time aggregate, it's a pretty extensive usage that is not at all similar to a stress test, but this is what matters. And to be fair with the first iPad, it's a field where it scores the same with iPad 2.

### The smart cover

I've read a lot about people who think it's the major feature and it's indeed a smart object. It really snaps the way it's supposed to snap and it's got a strong grip. However I'm not replacing my old combo (a [Colcasac sleeve](http://www.colcasac.com/ipad-sleeve/) and the [Griffin Loop](http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/loop) stand).

Compared with the loop stand, angles are a bit awkward to me: when you flip the cover to writing mode, it's a bit too flat and I tend to see too many reflections above the iPad. When you switch it to vertical, it's too close to 90 degrees and I constantly fear it could collapse. Moreover, there's no option to use the cover as a stand in portrait orientation.

It is indeed lightweight and it can be a decent portable stand (in bed as well it's good), but it doesn't replace the stand I use for extensive usage. 

### Bottom line

While it's a nice incremental upgrade, I wouldn't suggest it unless under specific situations and that's simply if you have a use for the HDMI mirroring/generic output on the TV. In my opinion that's the real killer feature, something that will be the solid ground for future great ideas. Aside from the Apple-mentioned academic applications, I can see a lot of potential for marketing and business and (needless to say) multiplayer games.
It's good to see that all the issues of the first iPad were tackled (edges and audio were the major ones in my opinion).

If it's your first iPad, then go for it and not for the first one as you will probably see something iPad2 only in the next months that will make you regret about this choice (I'm assuming also money is not an issue).

If you don't want to wait for the iPad 3, buying now or in a few months doesn't make the difference price-wise, as it will not change until iPad 3 is out.
