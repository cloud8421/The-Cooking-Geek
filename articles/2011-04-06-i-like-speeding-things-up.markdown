title: I like speeding things up
date: 06/04/2011

In shaping my workflow I’m continuosly working on two major tasks: focus and speed.
While the former is often discussed and talked through from a GTD perspective, I’d like to spend some words on speed.

<more>

Yesterday I spent some time with Nicola to review Jumpzero’s plans and show him what I’m working on, so we’ll be able to work together on our projects in the next weeks.
My main focus was to show him what I’m learning with Rails and what I’ve done so far on our first Rails app (an internal tool).
The effort made in these weeks paid off: I’ve setup is computer for Rails without any issues and my 2 days work prototype was enough to show him how this tool would work.
He came out with a sentence that made me think, something along the lines of “I can’t recognize your desktop from the last time I saw it”, meaning that the set of tools I was using, the windows I had open were different, essentially they were less. There was a multi-tab Terminal window and a Textmate project.

That has to do with speed: Rails lives in the Terminal and lots of tasks can be accomplished by the command line. While I could use a GUI for some of them, this would slow me down, even if I’d be using keyboard shortcuts, and that’s because I’d continuously change mindset adapting myself to another interface.

Speed means doing the same stuff in less time, not taking shortcuts. It means learn the right way to do something, learn how it works and then make it automatic if possible. It doesn’t mean that you need the best tool for any task you need to take care of, that may be expensive and time-consuming. It means, at least for me, to see if there’s a way to do it faster with what I’ve got already on my Mac, spend some time once to get it working and save time later on.

As a consequence, yesterday we spent more time talking about projects instead of making things work, which is fantastic.
