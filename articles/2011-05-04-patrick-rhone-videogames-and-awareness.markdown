title: Patrick Rhone, videogames and awareness
date: 04/05/2011

I'm reading [Patrick Rhone's Keeping It Straight](http://keepingitstraightbook.com/) and finding it insightful for the most part. There are some extreme views about minimalism and simplicity I simply don't share (I suppose that it also comes to general mindset difference between Italy and US and despite the philosophy behind your life - more on this will come when I finish the book and have a more cohesive opinion).

There's a quote about games I want to talk about:

>I rarely play games. In fact, I purposely avoid them. I know from past experience that I can get addicted to them and hours of my like can disappear. Frankly, I value those hours, especially as one only has so many to accomplish their goals for life.

I'm a videogames advocate: I've always played them, I worked with them, sometimes I've written about them. They've always been a part of who I am. I'm pretty sure they helped in shaping my personality, my vision of life, my attitude towards the (small, let's be honest) challenges I face every day.

Games can suck you out of your life if you let them, the same way a book or a movie does. Ask a late LOST fan how he watched the whole series: nine times out of ten he's watched episodes in batches.

It's a matter of control and awareness, something that Patrick really cares about. There's no need to find an excuse to play games: it's a residue of a past mindset that makes us believe that playing games is a waste of time.

I think that playing without choosing what to play is a waste of time. There are more games you'll be able to play, therefore be picky. Choose the ones that may resonate with you.

I play substantially less than the past years. I thought it was due to time, but reality is that taste changes, pleasure changes. Creating a small thing by myself, a script or a small piece of software, feels more rewarding to me, but there are games I take the time to play. A few a year, maybe. They always fill a hole in my imaginary, connect things that were apart, seed something that will bloom in expanding my interest about a particular topic.

The good thing about games is that they make it easy to dive deep in another universe. Whatever universe is, curiosity is key.

I'd suggest Patrick to devote some time to games without the need to find an explicit reason why (I'm also available for suggestions). The reason will present itself in the form of the [car keys he had lost once](http://patrickrhone.com/2010/11/02/finding-lost-things/). After all, he also says:

>As I said, I know how easily sucked in I can get with games. In this one [Canabalt] it is especially easy to say "I was robbed" or "I didn't mean to do that" and thus justify another round. Sometimes, you have to know when enough is enough, cut your losses, and live on to play another day.

This means he should be able to stop when he likes.
