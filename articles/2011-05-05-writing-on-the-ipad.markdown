title: Writing on the iPad
date: 05/05/2011

I don't think that the iPad may be an all-around work tool. Even if it's technically possible, you can't for instance write code on it without making some sacrifice of sort.

I find, however, that writing normal text on it is more pleasant than one would normally think.
As many people before me have suggested, I use [iA Writer](http://www.informationarchitects.jp/en/writer-for-ipad/), a minimal, Dropbox-enabled fullscreen writing app. It's only focus is on writing, so there's no formatting involved. Output is clean text.

Aside from the main font and the typography (they're both great), there are a few touches that make it extremely powerful:

- Additional keyboard buttons. There's a bit of a price to pay in terms of screen estate, but these buttons really speed up a lot the writing process, especially when it comes to navigating back and forth and managing parentheses (open and close with a single button). Commonly used punctuation is also there to help.
- Estimated reading time: I was familiar with word count, which is something that really has a meaning in a print world. On the web, word count may have a meaning in terms of ranges of content types, but it's a notion that is less useful than reading time. Some topics are best written about in a short post, some require some serious digging to be digested.

In any case, I've found myself using the iPad for writing more than I thought, even when I could use a full size keyboard with my Mac. I'm pretty sure it's also some sort of temporary separation from my primary work tool: shifting from the Mac to the iPad for a limited amount of time has a positive effect on my mind, it makes me focus on writing because I'm doing something more than firing up my writing tool of choice. I feel obliged to produce something valuable.

As a matter of fact, this very post was written on the iPad.
