title: Forgetting stuff
date: 28/03/2011

There was a time (which is like 1 year ago) where I could remember everything. I didn't need to write down any deadline, any appointment, anything at all. Memory was there to help me out and keep everything under control.

This is not the case anymore. I need to write down stuff, keep my to-do list organized, cross check that everything has been correctly processed and done.

I've been wondering why this is happening (I don't think it's age at all, as I'm only 27).

I think the reason lies simply in a shift in focus: in my old job I needed to juggle one hundred things at a time, constantly switching between a project and another. That started in the university, especially when it overlapped with work.

My actual job is completely different: it's less stuff, but generally longer, more complicated and often exhaustive for my mind. Now I focus on specific problems even for hours and this has gradually changed the way I'm approaching stuff: energy goes into the problem and not in remembering the problem itself.

Hopefully it's an improvement. It's without a doubt a different sensation, similar to a complex dish. You spend time preparing the ingredients, fill out the table, getting everything in perfect shape before the preparation itself. It takes some time, but when the real deal starts, you've got everything in your hands. You don't need to search for pepper, because it's right there where you put it 20 minutes before.
