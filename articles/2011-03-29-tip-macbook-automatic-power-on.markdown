Basically, here's my problem: I've got a [Henge Dock](http://www.hengedocks.com/) for my Macbook, which is something really useful because it lets you keep the computer in a vertical position with all the wires perfectly organized underneath. No mess at all and it really saves a lot of space on my small desk. The downside is that the Macbook has got the power switch under the lid, so it's not possible to turn it on with the lid still close. Bummer.

I've read many suggestions that suggested to simply put it to sleep during the night, but it's a useless power waste. I like to turn it off and cold boot it every morning.

That's where Trinity's post comes in: scheduled power on. Now my Macbook turns on at 8.00 am from Monday to Friday and only if it's connected to the power source. If I'm not home, power is not available (I've got energy saving power strips all around).
