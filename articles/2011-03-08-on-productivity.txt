title: On productivity
date: 08/03/2011

<p>Productivity is an evergreen topic. Digging deep into the matter, I&rsquo;ve found plenty of resources that would help you in making the most of your time (work or not, it&rsquo;s not really an issue). Most of them clearly tell that there&rsquo;s not a fixed recipe, however there are little things that can be overlooked. I&rsquo;m a developer, so that&rsquo;s my perspective. And bad for me, sometimes I don't follow my own rules.</p>

<h1 id="the_right_tool_for_the_right_job">The right tool for the right job</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started following <a href="http://minimalmac.com/">Minimal Mac</a>, a blog by Patrick Rhorne that focuses on a specific philosophy behind productivity, software and man-machine quality time. It gives some serious thinking material and I&rsquo;m developing my own vision on the whole matter.</p>
<p>First things first, you should have the right tool for the job. While this may sound easy, it&rsquo;s not. Most of the times you end up trying different solutions, installing many pieces of software, each one of them with a specific feature you would use. That doesn&rsquo;t work, especiallay because you&rsquo;re not giving them enough time. Asking around doesn&rsquo;t help either.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that it&rsquo;s extremely helpful for me to watch some screencasts that show how to do stuff I already know with a specific software. It&rsquo;s something I can measure, something I&rsquo;m able to evaluate.</p>
<p>Right now I&rsquo;m learning <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> and using <a href="http://macromates.com/">Textmate</a>. It&rsquo;s powerful and comfortable, however I had switched to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim/">MacVim</a> for HTML and Javascript. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll be using Textmate when I&rsquo;ll have a good grasp of Rails, I simply can&rsquo;t decide now. I&rsquo;ll surely try to see if MacVim works properly with Rails.</p>
<p>Practice gives power and professional use of software requires time and patience. It&rsquo;s better to hold with what you&rsquo;ve already got, get to know it deep and list its limitations. With those in mind, you can start the search for a better or complementary tool.</p>
<h1 id="don8217t_be_afraid">Don&rsquo;t be afraid</h1>
<p>I was skeptic to try out Vim and to go back to the command line. I really like graphical user interfaces, I enjoy using a good one and there&rsquo;s nothing I can&rsquo;t do with what I currently use.</p>
<p>My reason to try and switch was essentially speed. I write code, so the less I get far from the keyboard, the faster I can be. Moreover, I want to gradually learn how to correct some bad posture habits I developed. Going back to the command line, especially thanks to Ruby, Rails and GIT, feels refreshing. The core commands are indeed a few to learn, but it&rsquo;s worth the effort for 90% of the time spent during coding. I do switch to some more graphical tools (<a href="http://www.git-tower.com/">Tower</a> for GIT) is one of them when I need to incorporate the changes made by my fellow colleagues, but that&rsquo;s mainly for a fine grain control over potential conflicts.</p>
<p>Going back and forth with a keystroke, using some shortcuts and spending a little time to customize the environment I work in is essential to save time in the future and reduce at minimum any potential distraction.</p>
<p>While this may sound odd, I&rsquo;ve come to think that the command line has also a side effect and it&rsquo;s more attention to details. Pressing a button is easier, while pressing enter after writing a statement lets you think about it a bit more. It doesn&rsquo;t mean it takes more, it simply means that attention is completely focused on the command itself. Aside from a good looking monospace font, there&rsquo;s nothing beatiful to see in a Terminal aside from the background.</p>
<h1 id="templates_and_standards">Templates and standards</h1>
<p>This goes also for the accounting side of the job. No one likes to prepare invoices or contracts as a side effect of their job. Neither do I. That&rsquo;s why we have spent some time in preparing some templates, common resources and drafts. It&rsquo;s something that a company does and individuals or small teams should do as well.</p>
<p>When you start a new job, you shouldn&rsquo;t have a clean slate. That&rsquo;s poetry, not real life. You should have a foundation: a draft contract you can use, a template you can adapt to this job. Keep the slate for later, this is the boring part that needs to be done fast. Think about recurring issues in your work, all thos things that constantly go wrong in every job you take. Why is it still happening? It shouldn&rsquo;t. Try and face them before they happen. Make a checklist of them and try to address them. If you can, keep a couple of days off after a project to understand what went wrong, even the small things, so you can improve in the next one.</p>
<h1 id="instant_messaging">Instant messaging</h1>
<p>In most people&rsquo;s mind, working from home means doing whatever you want, which is partially true. It also means you create your own environment. It doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re always available for a friendly chat.</p>
<p>I sometimes put myself invisible, but the best thing to do is clearly state that you have to work. People will get used to it. In the end, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<h1 id="other_stuff_that_may_help_you_at_home">Other stuff that may help you at home</h1>
<p>I enjoy cooking and tea, it can be different for you. The only important thing is that you need to find a way to keep home separate from work, even if they share a physical location. You need to be able to stop working when needed and start back in no time.</p>
<p>Separate activities, never work and eat in the same spot, try to give yourself a schedule. Most people work 8 hours because they have to, you can work less or more and it&rsquo;s up to you. You just need to be consistent: if you don&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t time yourself. And if you can&rsquo;t do that, you can&rsquo;t forecast how long it will take to do a specific job and that means that 99% of the time you will work more and be paid less. Recording time is a good practice.</p>
<h1 id="blogs_and_podcasts">Blogs and podcasts</h1>
<p>That&rsquo;s key: there are several smart people around the world willing to share their opinion. They may be more expert than you, wiser and better. They&rsquo;re an inspiration and you can be like then or even better.</p>
<p>Learning is the first step, talking is the second: raise educate objections, speak your mind after some thinking. If they&rsquo;re really awesome the way they look, they&rsquo;ll point out the flaw in your logic knowing that we all need to learn something and there&rsquo;s always someone better.</p>
