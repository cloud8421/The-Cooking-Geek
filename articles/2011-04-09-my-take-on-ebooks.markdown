title: My take on ebooks
date: 09/04/2011

I'm not an avid reader. I guess I should be, but still I read only a few books a year.

There has been a lot of speculation about the future of books, the shift to digital publishing and the competition between Amazon and Apple (and all the other players). From a market point of view, it's still uncertain, despite the fact that Amazon undoubtedly provides the best experience through the Kindle (mostly in its physical form, but also with the ubiquitous software). On the other hand, Apple could potentially reach any iPad user out there, being iBooks the only application that gets promoted as soon as you open the App Store. I'd like to see how many people download it after that.

I'm one of those that is convinced that the physical book is here to stay. As [Iain Broome pointed out on his blog](http://writeforyourlife.net/5-ways-apple-could-improve-ibooks), there's room for both physical and digital books, as they serve different purposes.

> Why does it have to be a competition? Why can we not have a world where sometimes we read paper-based books and sometimes we read on a screen? The experience is different, sure. But that’s a good thing. Choice is good. An e-book is not a printed book. That’s the point.

I agree and I also want to add that the convenience of a digital book is not related to the way it can mimic the physical book experience. It's a matter of:

- **convenience**: you have more books in a single spot, always available for a quick look. This is key for manuals and reference books, especially if you own a lot of them. The Kindle has also an embedded dictionary and this really helps in keeping the focus on what you're reading.
- **availability**: most of the stuff I read comes from US and digital editions are usually the best way for me to make sure I get to read the book itself.
- **price**: digital books save me a lot of money, not just because they're less expensive than print editions, but also for shipping and handling.
- **space**: my house is small and this isn't going to change soon. When it's only content that matters, digital books are perfect for this situation. If there are production values that justify a print edition, I'll take that, but otherwise, having less stuff around is better.
- **weight**: some manuals are heavy due to the 500+ pages, meaning that they're not really comfortable to read unless you're on a desk. Digital manuals solve that issue as well.

There's also another factor, which may sound less important, but it's comforting to be able to have the books you want or need always with you. It makes the device you own more personal.

I think that Amazon got it right with the Kindle as a complete experience. They made an incredible device, extremely lightweight, affordable and easy to use.
It's easy to purchase books directly from it, you can have samples before buying (once again, great for manuals), everything is accessible even without a wi-fi connection (provided you have a 3G model).
It's not a matter of copying print editions, it's a matter of offering a compelling and complementary experience.
