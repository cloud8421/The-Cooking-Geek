title: 2 weeks in a solid state
date: 22/03/2011

As a power user, I started evaluating upgrades instead of changing the whole machine.

I've got the first 13" aluminum Macbook ever released (the one without the Firewire) and it served me well for a long time.
A few months ago it became my primary and only work machine, so I invested in a RAM upgrade to reach 4GB. The speed bump was visible, but it could easily get unnoticed in a normal day of work. As I don't use data-heavy applications, the main improvement was that I could keep more stuff open.

A few weeks later I changed hard drive and bought a 7200 rpm one. It is indeed faster than the standard one and everything started running more smoothly, with loading times decreasing for every application.

Three weeks ago I decided to switch to a solid state drive. I spent a good amount of time reading about them, listening podcasts and watching comparative videos.
It's not a cheap upgrade: I chose a [128 GB Mercury SSD](http://eshop.macsales.com/item/Other%20World%20Computing/SSDMX120/) and it was something like 250 â‚¬ (shipping and customs included, as it came from the US).

I simply cloned my boot disk with [SuperDuper](http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html) and swapped it with the SSD. After an initial configuration tweak (I manually set the boot partition - see here for an how-to) everything was up and running.

I almost never see the icon bouncing in the dock when I launch an app, everything opens instantly. Boot time is under 20", and I have quite some items in my menu bar.
XCode 4 launches in 10", any iWork application in 3", Safari with a 9-item grid open in 5".

As a side effect, the Macbook is completely silent. If the fan doesn't kick in, it makes absolutely no noise.

To keep it simple, this is the biggest upgrade I've ever experienced. It easily gives 2 years of life ahead for any traditional HDD-based machine and it's absolutely the most recommended upgrade to anyone.
