title: Single monitor goodness
date: 23/03/2011

I've always been a dual-monitor advocate until recently.

The reason was that I had come to appreciate the estate guaranteed by two monitors. With a good discipline and some serious keyboard shortcuts, you can get a lot done in development by keeping windows always visible.

As the time passes, I've come to think that I appreciated that workflow because I needed to verify every single step I made: even if I am still learning a lot, I've come to write good chunks of code without the need to execute every minor step. In other words, the time I spend in the editor is increasing.

Knowing that, I've tried to switch back to a single monitor, also because this helps me in keeping the right posture.

My focus is improving little by little, resulting in time better spent and things getting done more quickly.
As I said before, reducing the number of different softwares I use is helping as well.
