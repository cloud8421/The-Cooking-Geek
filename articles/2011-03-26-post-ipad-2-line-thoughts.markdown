title: Post iPad 2 line thoughts
date: 26/03/2011

Yesterday I spent half a day in the queue to buy an iPad 2. My first iPad will go to my father, who was absolutely amazing and wanted to make a gift and buy me a new iPad. Thanks Dad!

Anyway, I expected to find myself at ease among geeks, but instead I felt really out of place.
Conversations were all about 3G pricing plans and "ways to make the most out of your iPad without spending money", if you can read between the lines.

As a matter of fact, there was a sort of fanaticism I don't share. I'm an Apple user for the product quality, not for the logo itself. I've been using Linux for years before switching to Mac (but that's another story and I'd be curious to dig back a bit into it).

As I thought about it more and more, it's clear to me that it's not a matter of being faithful to a brand, but a matter of how to get the most out of the products I use. I'd be glad to see a successful [BlackBerry PlayBook](http://us.blackberry.com/playbook-tablet/) tablet and I'm curious about the upcoming [Noteslate](http://www.noteslate.com/).

Being a power user is not like signing a blood contract to sell your soul. It means digging deep into a system, know its shortcomings and appreciate its strengths. It means knowing how to make the most out of your machine, not simply staring at it as it was an idol.

I'm happy about my new iPad, but it's a physical object, so in the end it must not be a big deal. A certain kind of happiness is only made for people.
