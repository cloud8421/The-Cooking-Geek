title: Switchinh away from Things (for now)
date: 10/03/2011

<p>I&rsquo;ve always tried to have a somewhat solid method to manage tasks, but despite my good will I tend to shift from one system to another without real consistency. I still rely on memory not to forget about what I need to do and it&rsquo;s more or less worked so far.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried multiple times to use <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>, mostly for its beatiful user interface and its good balance between a project management and a todo list. I still feel that it applies an abstraction layer that makes everything more complicated than it sounds.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve decided to switch to a simpler tool, namely <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper">TaskPaper</a>. The reason is that it uses a simple markup language to in a pure text environment. No buttons unless you want to (and I just keep the search bar visible).</p>
<p>This helps me in keeping a similar mindset: coding is a form of writing, task management is anotheer form of writing, writing this post is a third form. Different languages but a common ground among them. I feel that being consistent in the way I work will be worth the effort.</p>
