title: "Alfred tip: multiple terminal commands"
date: 29/03/2011

I'm a faithful [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) user. It's got many features, however there's a trick I use constantly.

I often find myself using a terminal with 4 tabs for rails development. Sometimes I need to run the same command on all the tabs, but it's not a command I can automate with [TextExpander](http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/). I need to write it everytime. That's where Alfred comes in.

All I do is fire up Alfred, type the command and copy it in the clipboard. Hit Esc, and I'm back in the Terminal. The reason behind this is that I can't use some shortcuts in Terminal (like text highlight with  ⇧ + ⌥ + ← ).

On a side note, I heavily suggest you to use a double-press key activation for Alfred, it's much faster to use.
