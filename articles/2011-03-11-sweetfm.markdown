I’ve always enjoyed [Last.fm][], especially after having scrobbled a
decent amount of songs to customize it to my tastes (the fact that
they’ve somewhat changed during these years is another matter). What has
always bugged me was the fact that their application was not up to the
experience.

Having tried out the official app on multiple systems (namely, Linux and
Mac), I can see that they’re identical, so there has to be a
cross-platform development behind them.

This is where [SweetFM][] comes in: it’s Mac native, extremely lightweight,
visually small and elegant and does exactly what you want from a Last.fm
paid account: stream the music you like.

It stays hidden, plays music, no hiccups and no crashes. Compared to the
iTunes juggernaut, it’s refreshing.
