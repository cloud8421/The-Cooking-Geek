title: My next computer doesn't exist yet
date: 02/06/2011

My computer runs fine: there are no major grips or issues that prevent me from doing what I want with it. Despite the fact that it's a transitional model with some drawbacks, I made some upgrades that really push it to the limit. And for what I do, it's good enough.

As a geek however, I can't help but think about my next machine: I'm extremely fascinated by the latest [Macbook Air](http://www.apple.com/macbookair/) line, particularly by the 11 inches model. The idea of having such a small and fast machine really tickles me.

I'm pretty sure that I'll switch to a Macbook Air when the time comes, but there are practical reasons why I'm not doing it now: money (they're not that expensive, but I'm not that rich), the chance that new models may come out soon, the absence of some hardware features that may be important in the future.

There are also some other ones that are related to specific hardware and software topics:

- [A Thunderbolt port](http://www.apple.com/thunderbolt/): right now it's missing a Thunderbolt port, which is not a big deal now. I'm imagining that there will be some sort of hub that collect all your cables and connect it to the computer with a single Thunderbolt cable. That would be great to manage external disks, monitor and other USB peripherals.

- [A faster processor](http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/performance.html): SSD drives are great for general usage, but development may require some time-consuming processes that are faster with a faster CPU. I'm thinking about compiling programs, running tests when programming in Ruby and Rails. It's not a deal-breaker most of the times, however it adds a bit of overhead that I'd gladly avoid with a new machine. As for actual specs, the maxed-out 13" model is just slightly faster than my current machine (on the same Intel Core 2 Duo architecture). Having at least an I5 would be wonderful.

- [Mac OsX Lion](http://www.apple.com/macosx/lion/): it's in beta and many people say it's usable, fast and quite stable. I don't know, however, if the tools I use on a daily basis work properly. While I can find some information even now, nothing beats at least a month of public availability to have a detailed list of bugs and possibly solutions.

I'm positive that such a Macbook Air will be available before the end of the year, so it's just a matter of patience.
